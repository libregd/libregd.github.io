Yesterday, I ran into my old friend Fran. 

After finishing my daily fat loss exercise at the gym, I took the elevator down. As the doors opened, I noticed a lady who looked familiar. 

Memories started surfacing like bubbles rising in water, and it seemed like she recognized me too. 

Simultaneously, we called out each other's names and exchanged our WeChat IDs. 

It had been at least ten years since we last connected.
