Today I am very happyï¼Œbecause I bought a fish with discount 30% that enough eat 2 meals.

But I didn't do my daily English exercise, maybe I still can't adjust to the fast pace of study. I hope I will do better in future.

Another things is I did some design of bookmark, at beginning , I want to try silk-screen printing, but I gave it up ,found the way need many requires after seen a lot of tutorials. Then I think Laser engraving will made a fancy style, but that way will cost a lot of money.

And then I think PVC materials is cheap & easy to do. But it isn't sustainable and eco-friendly after reading more information.

Last, I find the technics that's named ink stamp, I think it's best choice for me.

Today, I'm really happy because I got a fish at 30% off, which is enough for two meals.

But I didn't do my daily English exercises. Maybe I'm still not used to studying at a fast pace. I hope I'll do better in the future.

I also tried making some bookmarks. At first, I wanted to try silk-screen printing, but I gave up when I realized it required a lot of things after watching tutorials. Then I thought about laser engraving, but it's too expensive.

Then I considered using PVC materials because they're cheap and easy to work with. But after reading more, I found out they're not good for the environment.

Finally, I discovered ink stamping, which seems like the best choice for me.
