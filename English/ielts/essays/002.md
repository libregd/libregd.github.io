Today I write a review about a book that's *What's brings the energy* , the author is a German named  *Eckart Löwe*.

He worked in the most deprived areas of China for 10 years without a salary return. Many people think that he had high ideals in his heart. But he said "no, I just do what I want to do." 

Others  bantered with him," Bro, you gave up the work in your own hometown, everybody know you should get a better life you deserved. You have a noble mind." In his book , he replied "why nobody believed that someone really like the life what himself choose to own."

I took many notes on the book, some pieces of his words touched my heart.

Today, I am writing a review about a book titled "What Brings the Energy" by a German author named Eckart Löwe.

Eckart Löwe dedicated 10 years of his life to working in the most impoverished areas of China, without expecting any financial return. Many people perceive him as having noble ideals, but he humbly states, "No, I simply do what I want to do."

Others jokingly commented, "Bro, you gave up your own hometown to work in such challenging conditions. Everyone knows you deserve a better life. You possess a noble spirit." In his book, he responds by asking, "Why does nobody believe that someone can genuinely enjoy the life they choose for themselves?"

While reading the book, I made several notes, and certain passages deeply resonated with me.

Today, I'm writing a review about a book called "What Brings the Energy" by Eckart Löwe, a German author.

Eckart Löwe spent 10 years working in the poorest parts of China without getting paid. Many people think he had lofty ideals, but he says, "No, I just do what I want to do."

Others teased him, saying, "Hey, you left your hometown and gave up a better life. You have a noble heart." In his book, he asks, "Why doesn't anyone believe that someone can genuinely enjoy the life they choose?"

While reading the book, I took lots of notes, and some of his words really touched me.
